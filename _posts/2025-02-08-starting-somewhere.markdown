Early in 2023 we found ourselves in a rut. On paper, everything
was going our way. We had jobs that appeared to be the pinnal of careers
successfully navigated, our kids were enrolled in an independent school
getting the best education we could offer them in the town we we lived in, and
we had enough income that we could buy wherever was in our Amazon cart without
thinking twice. We were growing more miserable by the week.

Below the surface we were drifting apart as a family. Neither my wife nor I
felt a deep level purpose in our careers, yet we were spending the majority of
our waking hours focused on them. Our kids had rich lives at school, but
didn't always feel like it was a place we felt deep levels of belonging to. And
most of our time spent physically together as a family was tarnished by an
ever increasing withdrawal of attention. Not all was lost because we had one
last card up our sleeves, Jackie and I had cultivated a relationship built on
a foundation of aggressive levels of transparency and communication. We did
what we always did when there was a problem we started talking.

Identifying that you need a change in your life is one thing, but actually
doing something about it is much harder. One tool we put to work here were a 
special type of pros/cons list where, whatever fork in the road you are
considering, you write down the pros and cons of taking deciding one direction
and also the pros and cons of not taking that path. The three options we were
deciding between were: 1) a move to a neighboring city that would allow us to
change some things, but keep our jobs; 2) I move cross country to a city we
were familiar with, but would require a bigger shift in our lives and careers;
or 3) take a family gap year.
