## The Turning Point

Early in 2023 we found ourselves in a rut. On paper, everything
was going really great for our family. We had jobs that were the result of
careers successfully navigated, our kids were enrolled in an independent school
getting the best education we could offer them, and we had enough income that we
could purchase whatever was in our Amazon cart without thinking twice. Yet we were
growing more miserable by the week.

It felt like we were drifting apart as a family. Neither my wife nor I
felt a deep level purpose in our careers, yet we were spending the majority of
our waking hours focused on them. It was clear that people appreciated us for
the work we were doing, but the more we toiled away as "experts" in our respective
fields, the more we became aware in the futility of all this "work."

Our kids had rich lives at school. That said, the school and parent community
didn't always feel deep levels of belonging to. School, as an institution,
has always felt like that. It is a place kids go while their parents are at work
so they too can be indoctrinated into a system that will put them to work doing
something that, at best, they enjoy doing for a while, but more likely, feel they
must do to eventually afford a "dream life" that they took no part in actually
dreaming up.

Most of our time spent physically together as a family was tarnished by an
ever increasing withdrawal of attention. There was always a lot of love and plenty
of temporary reprieves from the day-to-day that took the form of family camping and
travel---though reprieve is not the same thing as release and recovery. The majority
of our time was still spent on our custom-built hamster wheel, and no amount of
customization would make such a device make the experience of being on it feel any
less Sisyphean.

Not all was lost. Jackie and I have always worked hard to have a relationship based
on friendship, trust, and communication. This relationship we have is built for
self-preservation. So, we did what we always did when there was a problem, we
started talking.

## Making a Plan

One tool we used to create and evaluate potential changes to our life was a
special type of pros/cons list. It worked like this:

- Consider one possible fork in your life path
- Write down the pros and cons of deciding one direction
- Finally, and this is the important part, include the pros and cons of *not* taking that path


What you end up with is a 2x2 grid. Make one for every scenario you are consideringâ€”
no scenario should be rejected at face value. The more of these you have, the deeper
you will be able to dive into what *you* (not someone else) really want to make of
your future.

We did a fair amount of this, but in the end, the three options we were deciding
between were:

1. Move to a neighboring city that would allow us to change some things, but keep our jobs
2. Move cross-country to a city we were familiar with, but would require a bigger shift in our lives and careers
3. Take a family gap year

We chose path 3. Path 1 didn't offer enough change and path 2 was an option after
the gap year. That all said, calling a full-stop on life as we knew it to embrace a
year of travel and exploration opened up a lot of questions. What we knew we had to decide
first was a start date. This start date was really important for holding ourselves
accountable to making this path a reality. So, we decided on the beginning of the
next school year---we set our gap year kickoff to 10 September 2023.

This gave us about six months to start working our way down the following to-do list:

- Disengage from work---leave of absence, remote work agreements, quitting?
- Figure out homeschool for our rising 1st and 4th grade kids
- Move out of our home
- Put what things we would hold on to into storage
- Plan where we would go and how we would get there
- Budget for the next year
- Figure out what to do with the dog

## What Happened Next

What happened next after we decided on a gap year and set our start date was
reality. Six months is a long time and we had a lot to do and pacing out all
these steps is best done with steady progress. In the posts to come we will go
into more detail on each of these planning topics. That said, what happened next
for our family was that we had planted a seed, and this seed would gradually grow
into something that would result in the best year of our lives. With every
measure of progress made toward starting our gap year, the more engaged we became
as a family. We started talking about the future with wonder and excitement. We
felt a growing sense of liberation from the tracks of templated goals and dreams,
and started to take more creative liberties with our dreams. It took time, and
Jackie and I would regularly ask each other if "we were sure about this?", but
the gravity of this adventure was impossible to escape.
