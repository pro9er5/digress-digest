## The Work Question

When planning our gap year, one of the most significant decisions we faced was what
to do about work. On the surface, it might seem like a simple binary choice: either
quit your job or keep working remotely. However, like most important life decisions,
the reality was far more nuanced. We found ourselves contemplating three distinct
paths, each with its own set of implications for our gap year experience.

## Option 1: The Clean Break

The most dramatic option was to make a complete break from our careers. This meant
resigning from our positions and fully disconnecting from the professional world
for a year. The appeal was obvious---total freedom to immerse ourselves in the
experience without the tether of work responsibilities or the constant pull of
emails and meetings.

The pros of this approach were compelling:
- Complete mental freedom from work obligations
- Flexibility to travel without considering time zones or internet connectivity
- Opportunity to fully reset and potentially pivot careers afterward
- More present and engaged with our family adventures

But the cons were equally significant:
- Loss of all forms of steady income during the gap year
- Potential career impact and re-entry challenges
- Gap in employment history to explain (friends brought this up, we already weren't sure we wanted anything resembling our current work after a gap year)
- Need for a larger financial cushion before departing

## Option 2: Full-Time Remote

At the other end of the spectrum was maintaining our full-time positions while
working remotely. The rise of remote work during the pandemic had made this a more
viable option than ever before. We could keep our income streams while changing our
physical location---essentially combining work and travel.

The advantages were clear:
- Maintain financial stability and career continuity
- Keep benefits and professional connections
- Smaller financial burden on savings
- Easier transition back after the gap year

However, the drawbacks were substantial:
- Limited flexibility in travel planning due to work schedules
- Need for reliable internet and suitable workspaces
- Time zone challenges for meetings and collaboration
- Risk of not fully disconnecting from the work mindset
- Less time for family activities and exploration

## Option 3: The Hybrid Approach

Between these two extremes lay various hybrid possibilities. This could mean:
- Negotiating a part-time arrangement
- Taking a sabbatical with a guaranteed return
- Consulting or contract work on our own terms
- Project-based work with flexible hours

This middle path offered some intriguing benefits:
- Partial income while maintaining more flexibility
- Keeping one foot in the professional world
- Opportunity to be selective about work commitments
- Balance between financial security and freedom

The challenges were unique:
- Need to set and maintain clear boundaries
- Potential for work to gradually expand
- More complex planning and scheduling
- Variable income to manage

## Making the Decision

Like the 2x2 grid we used for our broader gap year decision, we evaluated each
work option not just for its immediate impact, but also for its longer-term
implications. We had to consider questions like:
- How would each choice affect our gap year experience?
- What would the financial implications be?
- How would it impact our careers in the long run?
- What would it mean for our personal growth and family dynamics?

We also had to acknowledge that my wife and I might make different choices. Our
careers, employers, and professional goals weren't identical, so it made sense that
our work arrangements during the gap year might differ as well.

## The Path Forward

In the end, the decision about work during our gap year wasn't just about
logistics or finances---it was about what we wanted to get out of this
experience. We had to be honest about our comfort with risk, our financial needs,
and most importantly, our vision for what this year could be.

The work decision was, in many ways, a microcosm of the larger gap year
choice---a balance between security and adventure, between the familiar and the
unknown. Whatever path we chose would fundamentally shape our gap year experience,
influencing everything from our travel patterns to our daily routines to our
family dynamics.

Ultimately, we chose options 1.5 and 3. Jackie is an educator and her employer
allowed her to take an unpaid leave of absence for one year and rejoin her district
as a full time teacher upon her return. I took the approach to negotiate an contract
for part-time independent consulting starting at time we kicked off our gap year.
I had a few ongoing projects and a technology I had invented that I could help support
remotely, while also working on a patent. Never did I feel stressed with this level
of involvement and it gave us a little financial cushion. 

Sometimes the hardest
part isn't choosing between good and bad options, but between different versions
of what could be an amazing year.
